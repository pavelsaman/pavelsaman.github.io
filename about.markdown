I'm a Software Tester currently based in Prague, CZE.

I'm passionate about learning new IT skills across different fields. My main focus these days is Linux testing.

Anything here is stuff I've been playing around with and want to have it summarized. I think someone else might find it useful as well, 
so why not to share it publicly.

If you feel like sharing something with me, get in touch through my [LinkedIn account.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavelsaman/)
