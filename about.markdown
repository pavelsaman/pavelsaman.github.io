I'm a Software Tester currently based in Prague, CZE.

I'm passionate about learning new IT skills across different fields. My main focus these days is testing and Linux.

Anything here is basically stuff I've been playing around and want to have it summarized. And since I'm facing these 
challenges, someone else might as well, so why not to share it publicly.

If you feel like sharing something with me, get in touch through my [LinkedIn account.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavelsaman/)
