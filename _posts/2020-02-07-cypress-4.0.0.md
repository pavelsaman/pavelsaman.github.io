I've upgraded to Cypress 4.0.0 today, and there're [a few changes](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog.html#4-0-0) in this new version, and especially one I want to briefly talk about.

Up until today, if you wanted to run multiple tests (but not all of them) in your suite, you couldn't really do it. The idea of appending `.only` to multiple tests did not really work in reality. Other people struggled with the same, so in 2018, [this issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2828) was filled on Cypress github page. And finally today, it's possible to use `.only` with multiple tests in one test suite in a way that all of these tests will be run during one execution.

Following up on the example from the github page, it now works like this:

```
describe('do something', function() {
  it.only('1 does this', function (){...}) // runs
  it('2 does that later', function (){...}) // doesn't run
  it.only('1 does this', function (){...}) // runs
})
```

I can think of especially one use case when this new feature proves useful. When I want to run just 2 or any other small number of test cases out of many, then I don't need to write `.skip` to all those many test cases.

Try it, it works just fine :)
