I guess the title of this article is as catchy as the cover and name of the book [The Art of Thinking Clearly](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AJP267G/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_NlzXEbKWD0QQW) by Rolf Dobelli. However, having read the book, it surprised me how well-written it is. I can't but recommend this book to anyone who is even remotely conserned with testing.

The book presents 99 short chapters, each on a different topic related to critical thinking and the most common traps we often fall into when making decisions. Testers (anybody really :)) should be good critical thinkers since they need to uncover problems that are many times not easy to find out, or that have been missed by other people. Therefore, reading about critical thinking should be on every tester's list of things to do.

Don't expect to become an expert after reading the book, but it should help with identifying situations in which human brain usually flaunders. You also should be able to ask better questions and focus on core points and problems. Being able to learn just some bits and pieces of this book might actually improve the way you test.

I might share some ideas learnt from the book in future articles because I find this interesting and useful enough to review every now and then. Since then, I think it's worth of your time and money to get a copy and read it.
