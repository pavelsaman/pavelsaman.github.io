Long time no new article here! It's been almost two months. However, I've been writing a book about e2e tests in TestCafe. You can get it on [leanpub](https://leanpub.com/TestCafeTests) now.

You can go see the [landing page of the book](https://leanpub.com/TestCafeTests), this is how the cover looks like:

It's pretty much about those topics I mention there:

> I intend this book to become a quick guide for topics that are usually not mentioned in documentation. Topics such as project structure, test suite and test structure, where to place assertions, how to deal with config values for multiple test and language environments, how to set up your IDE are topics you often need to google. I have collected such topics in this short book. I hope the book will help you as much as it helps me when I forget something and need to look it up quickly.

So if you are interested, you can buy it. If you use TestCafe on a daily basis, it will become useful.

To write almost 10,000 words took me some time, especially when you consider I rewrote big parts of it a couple of times. It's definitely much more difficult to write something longer than a blog post. But I enjoyed the process of writing it.
