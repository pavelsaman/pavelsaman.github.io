Honestly, I'm surprised by the success of stackexchange sites. I've recently answered a few questions there and read some other questions, and I'm stunned at the fact what people are able to ask. Let's me show you what I mean.

First of all, it all starts with a user name. I mean when I don't know how to solve something, I usually try a bit harder to come across as someone sensible so I make a reasonable name, leaving out the default option such as user123456, and some other options like "Top Coder" etc. that are frankly laughable when all you do is ask about how to create a dictionary in Python and iterate over its keys.

But that's only a start, there's much more that users don't do and they should, namely:

- level of English: It's usually very poor with occasional exceptions. Again, learning English when you're in IT is **step number one**, I'd go even as far as saying that if your level is not at least C1, you should **not** even try to get yourself a job in IT. Why? Beacuse you'll be constantly hitting the wall when someone sends you an article about some technology and you won't be able to understand its details. Yes, details. They matter and you're hardly able to comprehend the details when you're fighting your B1 English.

- typos: Peple would leve typos in the questions quit often. Did you enjoy reading the previous sentence? I doubt it. Read what you have written, read it already formatted since it gives you another perspective. And smooth out all the typos you made.

- debugging: Why bother, right? You just post a question with a well-formed title such as _"Please help"_ and place there your 20 lines of broken code, ideally as plain text. I guess stackexchange can create a bot that would just add _"What have you tried? How did it fail?"_ comment under every second question just as precaution.

- information provided: This goes with the previous point. Many users don't even bother to add an error message, their code and other concrete examples of what happens on their side. If you're unwilling to work on your question, how do you expect someone will help you?

- no participating in a solution: People just expect other people will solve their problems. Where does this attitude come from? I mean I'd be ashamed to even ask if I hadn't tried myself first. This is the first step in the process, you try yourself first, you debug it, you search on the internet, you understand it well, you experiment, then you ask.

- _"hey bro"_: Are we in some sort of ghetto? Are you a professional or are you just making fun of me? Why would you even call me bro if all we have in common is you asked some question and I try to help you out? Think about yourself, perhaps you can go into a different field, this is really out of question in IT. And I do understand there're such things and different cultures, but you don't understand that the internet discussion about technical stuff should be void of such particularities, that's mostly a neutral space, so leave it out.

- _"it doesn't work"_: Alright, and why should I care? I mean you want me to sort it out for you? Perhaps I'd try if you followed all previous points, but when there's not even an error message, not any code, not even what you have tried, I'm afraid I'll just move on.


I can go on and on. There're also people who if they get a link to some e.g. library that solves their problem, they would not even read the link and ask again. Or move to a neighboring stackexchange site and ask there in the hope the person who tried to help them for the first time won't notice they just copy-pasted the same question to a different site. How rude.

I think the following comment shared with me by a friend of mine wraps it up precisely: _"Nothing works unless you do."_
