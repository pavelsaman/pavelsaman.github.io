A quick recommendation on what to read in the field of software testing.

I've recently got to read this book about software testing:

I must say this is absolutely amazing book about the field. I won't go into details here but I definitely recommend this one.

Perhaps not a new one, but the advice is timely and could be applied or considered any time, even in today environment.

Enjoy reading.
