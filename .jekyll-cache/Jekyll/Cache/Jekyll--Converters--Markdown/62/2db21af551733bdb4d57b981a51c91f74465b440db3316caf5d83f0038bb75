<p><img src="/images/testing_book.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I must say this is absolutely amazing book about the field. I wonâ€™t go into details here but I definitely recommend this one.</p>

<p>Perhaps not a new one, but the advice is timely and could be applied or considered any time, even in today environment.</p>

<p>Enjoy reading.</p>
