I"å<p>In language acquisition, there‚Äôs an idea of the most common words in a language. It can be interesting to know this when learning a new language. I‚Äôll try to analyze Harry Potter and the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone in order to show word frequency and how many of the 1000 most common English words are represented in the book, so one has an idea how much of the book is possible to read when knowing only this set of words (of course it‚Äôs a simplification, but an interesting one).</p>

<h3 id="plain-test">Plain Test</h3>

<p>Number one task I hae is to get the book in plain text, so I can process it. I‚Äôve found it online and the result <a href="/files/hpps">is in this text file</a>. To see just first 10 ilnes to get an idea, the file looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER ONE

THE BOY WHO LIVED

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last
people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,
because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="clearing-the-data">Clearing the Data</h3>

<p>When I have a look at the file, there‚Äôre a few problems with the text:</p>
<ol>
  <li>some words use both <code class="highlighter-rouge">[A-Z]</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">[a-z]</code> ranges</li>
  <li>there‚Äôre some numbers (page numbers etc.) that I don‚Äôt consider numbers</li>
  <li>there are empty lines</li>
  <li>there‚Äôs punctuation that can spoil individual words</li>
  <li>but not all <code class="highlighter-rouge">[[:punct:]]</code> is problematic - e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">you've</code> is alright</li>
</ol>

<p>I need to get rid off all these data, so I have a ‚Äúclean‚Äù text as input for frequency analysis.</p>
