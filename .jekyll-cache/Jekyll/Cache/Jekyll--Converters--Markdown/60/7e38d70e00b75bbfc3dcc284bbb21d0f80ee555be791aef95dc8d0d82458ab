I"<p>I’m a Software Tester currently based in Prague, CZE.</p>

<p>I’m passionate about learning new IT skills across different fields. My main focus these days is Linux and testing.</p>

<p>Anything here is stuff I’ve been playing around with and want to have it summarized. I think someone else might find it useful as well, 
so why not to share it publicly.</p>

<p>If you feel like sharing something with me, get in touch through my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavelsaman/">LinkedIn account.</a></p>
