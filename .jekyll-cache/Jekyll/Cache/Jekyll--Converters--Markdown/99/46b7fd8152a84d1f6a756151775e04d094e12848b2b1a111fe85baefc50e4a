I"l<p>Lightdm is a light desktop manager that could be configured in a few ways. One of the things I want to change regularly is the lightdm greeter background, so I get a new picture on my login screen every week.</p>

<p>When I have a look into lightdm settings, I can see I can easily change its background: <img src="/images/lightdm_greeter_settings.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>On the other hand, I have more than just one picture I like and I’d like to rotate them every now and then, let’s say once a week.</p>

<p>The way I approached this is a small bash script that I’m now going to share in this post.</p>
