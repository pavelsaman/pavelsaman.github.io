I"M	<p>Just a quick article on how to find out BIOS version and how to get an update, and finally how to upgrade it.</p>

<p>I’ve recently done exactly this on my Dell E5550 laptop.</p>

<p>First, my BIOS version was A06:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>dmidecode <span class="nt">-s</span> bios-version
A06
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next question is how to find out if there’s a new version for my laptop. I had to first get a serial number of my machine:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>dmidecode <span class="nt">-s</span> system-serial-number
xxxxx <span class="c"># don't want to make it public</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then on <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/uk/en/ukdhs1">Dell website</a>, I copy-pasted my serial number and let the system find new updates.</p>

<p>Surely, there was a new BIOS version <code class="highlighter-rouge">A21</code>.</p>

<p>It’s always an <code class="highlighter-rouge">.exe</code> file, no matter what OS you have. There’s also a good tutorial on how to upgrade BIOS on Linux machines. The tutorial there is for Ubuntu since that’s an OS that’s delivered by Dell along with MS products.</p>

<p>The steps I did were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I downloaded the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.exe</code> file</li>
  <li>I verified checksums of the downloaded file against what Dell has on their website</li>
  <li>I formatted a usb flash drive, it’s important to use FAT 32</li>
  <li>I copied the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.exe</code> file onto my flash drive</li>
</ol>

<p>Then it’s all about rebooting, pressing <code class="highlighter-rouge">F12</code> and selecting <code class="highlighter-rouge">BIOS Flash Update</code>. The rest should be automatic and if there’re no problems, the BIOS should be upgraded to a new version (in my case A21), which I can confirm either in BIOS setup or after boot in my OS:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>dmidecode <span class="nt">-s</span> bios-version
A21
</code></pre></div></div>
