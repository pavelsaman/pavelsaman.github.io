I"I<p>Jira is a popular tool for software development. One of the ways in which Jira is used for is bug reporting. I’ve recently faced a situation where there was no structure to bug reports in Jira, leaving it completely up to a Tester. I’ll try to argue for why this is not the best practice and how it could be improved.</p>
