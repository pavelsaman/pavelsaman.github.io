I"à<p>Jira is a popular tool for software development. One of the ways in which Jira is used for is bug reporting. Iâ€™ve recently faced a situation where there was no structure to bug reports in Jira, leaving it completely up to a Tester. Iâ€™ll try to argue for why this is not the best practice and how it could be improved.</p>

<p>The following printscreen is how bugs are added into Jira.</p>

<p>A new bug is simply described in field: Thatâ€™t exactly what I want to write about on the following lines.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-describe-bug">How to Describe Bug</h3>

<p>A bug needs to be described somehow. Depending on a context, it could be a long report or one sentence. However, in any situation, what needs to be described is at least:</p>

<ol>
  <li>environment, app version</li>
  <li>what data was used - like testing users, values in input fields etc.</li>
  <li>how to reproduce the bug, so some steps</li>
  <li>what the current state is</li>
  <li>what the desired state is</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, each of these steps could be more or less formal, depending on a context! But a Tester always needs to think along these lines, and only then decide what format (formal, informal) to choose.</p>

<p>Fairly easy, what I have a good experience with is adding a simple template that would automatically add these 4 guidelines. A Tester doesnâ€™t need to keep everything in their head and if thereâ€™re some less experienced testers on the team, they might even use this as a reminder what not to forget when filling in new bug reports.</p>

<p>The final Jira could look like this:</p>
