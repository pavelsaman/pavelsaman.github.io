I"Æ<p>Lightdm is a light desktop manager that could be configured in a few ways. One of the things I want to change regularly is the lightdm greeter background, so I get a new picture on my login screen every week.</p>

<p>When I have a look into lightdm settings, I can see I can easily change its background: <img src="/images/lightdm_greeter_settings.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>On the other hand, I have more than just one picture I like and Iâ€™d like to rotate them every now and then, letâ€™s say once a week.</p>

<p>The way I approached this is a small bash script that Iâ€™m now going to share in this post.</p>

<p>First off, we need to find out where is a config file of the lightdm greeter. Iâ€™d try <code class="highlighter-rouge">man lightdm</code> and scrol down to the FILES section:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>FILES
       /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
              Configuration

       /etc/lightdm/users.conf
              User list configuration <span class="o">(</span><span class="k">if </span>not using Accounts Service<span class="o">)</span>

       /etc/lightdm/keys.conf
              XDMCP keys
</code></pre></div></div>
