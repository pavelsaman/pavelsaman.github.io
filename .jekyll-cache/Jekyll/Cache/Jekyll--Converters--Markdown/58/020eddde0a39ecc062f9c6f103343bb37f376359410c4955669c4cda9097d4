I"=<p>When using LightDM display manager, one also has to install a greeter. Iâ€™ve been using LightDM GTK Greeter, which is a light greeter that could be configured in a few ways. However, one of the things I want to change regularly is the greeter background, so I get a new picture on my login screen every week.</p>
