I"<p>Like it or not, a lot of time as a tester will be spent checking inputs and whether the system fails or not. One way we can do this is basically using the final product, that is via a GUI interface as a user. We can call a user testing or differently, it’s not that important to remember the eve-growing list of names in software testing, it’s important to use your own brain and think about the testing you do.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, there are many different fields a web page or any other app (mobile, desktop) can have. There’re input fields for text, for numbers, checkboxs, radio buttons etc. For each of them, you need to consider a bit different set of checks/tests.</p>

<p>For this article, I’ll choose as an example a simple search field as shown here:</p>

<p><img src="/images/search_field.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>It’s a search field from a web application.</p>

<p>Long time ago, I was asked this very question (a bit broader in fact, but this was part of it) during an interview. Well, as a newcomer to SW testing, I stuttered out 1 or 2 thinks in the list I utilize nowadays. I don’t feel particularly good about it now, but everyone has to start somehow.</p>
