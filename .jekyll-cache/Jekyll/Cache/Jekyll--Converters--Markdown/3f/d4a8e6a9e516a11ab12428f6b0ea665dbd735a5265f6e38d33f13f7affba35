I"Î<p>I feel this topic is really important for many reasons. I also have recent experience that proves people are not that good at this, or they donâ€™t try hard enough. Iâ€™ll try to write a bit about this and hopefully convince a few about the importance of good questions.</p>

<h3 id="why-to-ask-good-questions">Why To Ask Good Questions?</h3>

<p>Iâ€™ll dive right in and say a few words about why I think this is absolutely crucial to ask good questions. It turns out that people ask questions when they need something. So a useful answer is usually what they hope for. However, does really anybody feel like helping other people when they pose a stupid, broad, vague etc. question? I donâ€™t think so! Such questions tend to be avoided, answered in a similar manner, handed to somebody else or, at best, people who ask such dumb questions get, instead of an answer, a question in return. Any of these waste time and nothing gets solved.</p>

<h3 id="attributes-of-good-question">Attributes of Good Question</h3>

<p>When we know why to ask good questions, letâ€™s have a look at what you should do in order to ask good questions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Be concrete</li>
  <li>Present details</li>
  <li>Say whatâ€™s your objective - why are you asking in the first place? what do you want to achive? there might be a better/easier solution</li>
  <li>Present what you have already tried and why it didnâ€™t work or what results you got - it shows youâ€™re not lazy and that you actually try to solve your problems first, thatâ€™s always a good strategy</li>
  <li>Say where you have tried to look for an answer - people wonâ€™t point you towards the same resource, so youâ€™re not wasting anybodyâ€™s time</li>
  <li>Suggest what direction youâ€™d take next and even ask if one of them might be the right one - it shows youâ€™re thinking about the problem and that you try to be an active participant in finding the solution</li>
  <li>If your question is written, read it after yourself, correct typos, grammatical errors etc. - you show youâ€™re not illiterate :)</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t put the blame on anybody, rather assume youâ€™ve missed something - itâ€™s easy to point a finger on other people, but the odds are that youâ€™re likely to be wrong and that youâ€™ve missed something important</li>
</ol>

<p>There might be more points, but Iâ€™m sure that following just these will dramatically improve your questions, and in turn the way people respond to them. You will simply get relevant answers faster!</p>

<h3 id="examples-of-bad-questions">Examples of Bad Questions</h3>

<p>Itâ€™s time to show you a few beauties what should never be asked.</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">This doesn't work, how can I fix it?</code> Okâ€¦ what doesnâ€™t work? Why do you want to fix it? What do you want to achive? Why should I do some thinking instead of you? What have you tried? â€¦ I can go on and on. And Iâ€™m not very willing to help you.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Im using robot framework. Both the if part and else part is executing. Can anybody help me with this? Thank you</code> Where is the code? Do you really expect anybody to help you out when you canâ€™t even provide the faulty code? What have you tried? Why should I solve your problems? Even if Iâ€™m super nice, my only answer could be just <code class="highlighter-rouge">yes</code>, because youâ€™re not asking how to solve the problem, youâ€™re asking if somebody can help youâ€¦</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Why this doesn't work?</code> Why do you assume it doesnâ€™t? What do you expect to see? How did you end up in this situation?</li>
</ol>

<p>I think Iâ€™ll stop here :)</p>

<h3 id="example-of-good-questions">Example of Good Questions</h3>

<p>Good questions tends to be longer, so Iâ€™ll link <a href="https://sqa.stackexchange.com/questions/40564/codeception-test-data-in-annotation-codeception-reports-undefined-variable">this one question I posted in sqa.stackexchange.com</a>. Iâ€™m brave enought to say I asked a good question. It was concrete, I showed what steps I took, and I didnâ€™t assume there was something wrong with Codeception, but rather I missed something. And of course I missed a fairly stupid thing. I just didnâ€™t see that. The important thing is I got a solution/answer in 12 minutes. How long would it have taken had I asked in some broad, impolite way?</p>

<p><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1480011/flask-app-inside-a-docker-container-is-not-served-to-localhost-when-using-docker/1480056#1480056">Another question</a> I asked. It starts with a fairly concrete title, then I presented detail steps I took and results of each one of them. I show I checked that the container is running. I described what I didnâ€™t see and what I expected to see. I also included versions of the products I used. All this trouble of defining my question precisely eventually led me to investigate further and I found a solution myself (which I posted there as well). Asking good questions has a strong potential to lead you to the right answer with no help at all. Sometimes you just need to summarize it and go over it once again.</p>

<p>I hope Iâ€™ve presented enough examples on either side, so Iâ€™ll leave it here. Feel free to let me know if I missed something important.</p>
