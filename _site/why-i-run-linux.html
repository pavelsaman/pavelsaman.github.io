    <p>I want to express just a few reasons why I go for Linux as my main operating system. It’s not an attempt on an exhaustive list, just a few items off the top of my head.</p>

<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>The most important reason for me is Linux allows me to learn more about different parts of the system, config files, data formats, tools etc.</p>

<p>A lot of things could be set up in Linux, even details that I didn’t thought possible when coming from the Windows platform. It might be a bit overwhelming at the beginning, but it also means a lot of new things could be learnt. As a result, I understand more IT stuff and that’s a big plus since it happens to be my job as well.</p>

<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>

<p>It directly follows the previous point. Linux could be tweaked to the smallest detail. Both user interface and many stuff that run in the background and are not directly visible to the user. If something is acting up, the high changes are I can find it out with not so much effort.</p>

<h3 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h3>

<p>It might not come across as the most obvious reason at first, but I actually think using command line environment is more efficient than using a mouse. Using pipes, running various programs by just typing a few characters are simply faster, and it means a lot to me.</p>

<p>I can also look at the topic from the point of view of the system. It doesn’t consume many resources. When I don’t work on my machine, everything on the system is quiet, the CPU usage is low, RAM is free, when I have a look at the network interface, there’s no traffic etc. Whereas on my Windows machine, it’s always on like 70 % of RAM capacity, the same with the CPU and disk, and the machine is always talking to the outside world via its network interface. I guess some of these things could be turned off, but just the default behaviour scares me. Why not turn off almost everything and let the user decide what to use?</p>

<h3 id="gui">GUI</h3>

<p>While criticised a lot by mostly non-linux users, I find it much nicer. And there are many options to choose from. You can have GNOME, KDE, LXDE, Cinnamon, MATE, Xfce, LXQt all the way down to some really light environments like Openbox.</p>

<p>Furthermore, any desktop environment could be further tweaked and changed to the needs of every user.</p>

<p>However, try to add a custom clock format on a panel in Windows. You have to go into registry! What a thing!</p>

<p>These are my reasons for using Linux. I could find out more as I learn more about the system, but even now after just half a year of using Linux everyday as my main system, I can’t but say it was definitely a good choice to switch to this platform.</p>
